      Privacy Policy
    </h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how and when I collect, use, and share
      information when you purchase an item from me, contact me, or otherwise
      use my services.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that
      I do not own or control.
    </p>

    <h3>Information that I collect</h3>

    <p>
      To fulfill your order, you must provide me with certain information, such
      as your name, email address, mailing address, payment information, and
      details of the product you are ordering. You can also choose to provide me
      with additional personal information (for a personalized order for
      example), if you contact me directly.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I need your information and how I use it</h3>

    <p>
      I rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use and share your
      information, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        as needed to provide my services, such as when I use your information to
        fulfill your order, to settle disputes or to provide customer support;
      </li>
      <li>
        when you have given your affirmative consent, which you can revoke at
        any time, for example by subscribing to my mailing list;
      </li>
      <li>
        if necessary to comply with a legal obligation or a court order or in
        the context of a legal action, such as keeping information about your
        purchases if the tax legislation requires it; And
      </li>
      <li>
        as required by my legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests
        are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as 1) providing and
        improving my services. I use your information to provide the services
        you have requested and in my legitimate interest to improve my services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

    <p>
      Information about my customers is important to my business. I share your
      personal information for very limited reasons and in limited
      circumstances, as follows:
    </p>

    - Service providers. I engage certain trusted third parties to perform
    functions and provide services to my store, such as delivery companies. I
    will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to
    the extent necessary to provide these services. - In accordance with the
    laws. I may collect, use, retain and share your information in the good
    faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal
    process or government requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and
    policies; (c) prevent, investigate and combat fraud and other illegal
    activities, security or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights,
    property, and safety of my customers or others.

    <h3>Data retention</h3>

    <p>
      I only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
      provide my services to you and as described in my privacy policy. However,
      I may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal
      and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes and enforce my agreements. I
      generally keep your data for the following period: 4 years.
    </p>

    <h3>Transfers of personal information outside the EU</h3>

    <p>
      I may store and process your information through third-party hosting
      services in the United States and other jurisdictions. Accordingly, I may
      transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction with different data
      protection and government oversight laws than your jurisdiction. If I am
      deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, I rely on
      Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer, as Google Cloud and
      Dropbox are Privacy Shield certified.
    </p>

    <h3>your rights</h3>

    <p>
      If you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number
      of rights regarding your personal information. Although some of these
      rights generally apply, some rights only apply in certain limited
      circumstances. I describe these rights below:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Access. You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the
        personal information that I hold about you by contacting me using the
        contact details below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modify, restrict, delete. You may also have the right to modify,
        restrict my use of, or delete your personal information. Absent
        exceptional circumstances (such as when I need to store data for legal
        reasons), I will generally delete your personal information upon
        request.
      </li>
      <li>
        Object. You can object to (i) my processing of some of your information
        based on my legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages
        from me after giving your express consent to receive them. In such
        cases, I will delete your personal information unless I have compelling
        legitimate grounds to continue using that information or it is needed
        for legal reasons.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complain. If you are located in the EU and wish to raise concerns about
        my use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights
        you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data
        protection authority.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to contact me</h3>

    <p>
      For the purposes of EU data protection law, I, Joreel Siegel, am the
      controller of your personal information. If you have any questions or
      concerns, you can contact me at shop@princessnugget.com.
